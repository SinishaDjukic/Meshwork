 * 2) We have received an ACK
 * 3) We have received a message

 * The simple 3xLED user interface doesn't allow us to differentiate between
 * failed sends, BCAST vs SCAST, sending message vs sending ACK, although
 * this is all possible with the NetworkV1::RadioListener interface.
 *
 * On the other hand, the below implementation should nicely visualize
